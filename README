After successful build copy these folders

root/* to ROMSOURCE/out/target/product/codename/root/*
system/* to out/target/product/codename/system/*

#
#	These files are precompiled binaries for extra android su features.
#

## Currently ported (For the note these all are static for ld, gcc, g++)
* bash 5.x
* Perl5 (new)
* m4 (new)
* make
* ncurses (may be broken)
* readline (new)

# Do port i have simple and short guide
* use ubuntu 18.04
* get g++ binutils and gcc for arm-linux-gnueabihf
* and use CFLAGS="-pie -static" LDFLAGS="-pie -static" CXXFLAGS="-pie -static"
* also another note all binaries dont support cross compile or dont like the includes/libs u have for the cross compiler. Good luck.
